    <h1>Coding Challenge 4</h1>

    <p>
        From the first coding challenge, remember Mark and John comparing their BMI's. In this challenge we will be implementing the same functionality using objects and methods. <br>
        <br>

        <ol>
            <li>For each, create an object with properties for full name, mass, height.</li>
            <li>Add a method to each object to calculate their BMI and return it.</li>
            <li>Log to the console who has the highest BMI, together with fill name and respective BMI. They might also have the same BMI.</li>
        </ol><br>

        <pre>
            Note: BMI = mass / height^2, where mass is in kg and height in meter 
        </pre>
